# React Redux Template with TypeScript

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I set up my own template to use in personal projects :fire:

In this template, I made a simple `<Counter />` with react and redux/toolkit:
* Increment :+1:
* Decrement :-1:
* Increment amount :100:
* Fetch my github [ID](https://api.github.com/users/alexalannunes) :boy:
* Some tests with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

### Created with
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

* [Redux.js](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Redux/Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
